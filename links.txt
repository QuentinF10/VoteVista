Ballot Counting Machines
A ballot paper scanner is a voting machine, which doesnâ€™t change the election process for the voters. Just like conducting a conventional election, the voter marks his vote on a printed ballot paper. Only the next step - ballot counting - differs from conventional systems. Ballot papers are scanned by the computerized voting machine, which reads the marks on the ballot paper and counts the vote. This takes a lot of pressure off from the election volunteers, making the process easier, more efficient, and faster.
